OWASP Buea
----------

## Welcome
The OWASP Buea Chapter was established in 2024 with the aim of promoting secure software development practices in the local tech community. We focus on application security, sharing best practices, and fostering collaboration to build a diverse and vibrant security community in the region. Additionally, we actively work to build a diverse and inclusive security community by organizing workshops, meetups, and hackathons targeted at different experience levels.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.
