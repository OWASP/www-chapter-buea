OWASP Buea
----------

## Welcome
The OWASP Buea Chapter was established in 2024 with the aim of promoting secure software development practices in the local tech community. We focus on application security, sharing best practices, and fostering collaboration to build a diverse and vibrant security community in the region. Additionally, we actively work to build a diverse and inclusive security community by organizing workshops, meetups, and hackathons targeted at different experience levels.

## Participation
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) is a nonprofit foundation that works to improve the security of software. All of our projects, tools, documents, forums, and chapters are free and open to anyone interested in improving application security.

Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in our [Projects](/projects/), [Local Chapters](/chapters/), [Events](/events/), [Online Groups](https://groups.google.com/a/owasp.com/){:target='_blank'}, and [Community Slack Channel](https://owasp.slack.com/){:target='_blank'}. We especially encourage diversity in all our initiatives. OWASP is a fantastic place to learn about application security, to network, and even to build your reputation as an expert.

## Event: [OWASP Buea Chapter Meeting - June 2025 (Online)]()

**Group: [Buea](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-buea/)**

**Time: 21:00 (WAT)** 

**Link: https://www.meetup.com/owasp-buea-chapter/events/308313304**

**Description:** We’re excited to kick off OWASP Buea Chapter meetups for 2025! This will be our first session of the year, and we’re inviting developers, security professionals, students, and tech enthusiasts to join us for a practical and insightful virtual meetup. This session will focus on the growing importance of web and mobile application security. As more financial services and everyday tools move online especially in the banking and fintech space understanding how to secure these applications is no longer optional. We'll explore real-world security issues and how attackers exploit them, using a deliberately vulnerable banking application developed by Al-Amir Badmus. We’ll also take some time to reintroduce the OWASP Buea Chapter, meet the chapter leaders, and talk about what’s planned for the rest of the year.

Agenda

  Welcome & Chapter Vision for 2025
    Meet the three OWASP Buea Chapter leaders and get a quick overview of the chapter’s mission, what we stand for, and the kind of activities we’re planning this year.
  What is OWASP?
    A short introduction for those new to the community. What OWASP does globally, why it matters, and how you can get involved locally and remotely.
  Demo Session – Exploring OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities
    Using a real-world inspired, intentionally vulnerable banking app, we’ll walk through several common issues from the OWASP Top 10. Expect to see practical examples of:
    Insecure APIs
    Broken access controls
    Injection vulnerabilities
    And more

We’ll also look at how to detect these issues and discuss best practices for building more secure apps especially in environments where mobile and API-based architectures are the norm.
Why attend?
    Get hands-on exposure to real security issues developers and testers face today
    Understand how OWASP tools and projects can support your learning or organization
    Meet like-minded professionals and grow your network in the security space
    Learn how to contribute to the chapter or OWASP projects

Please RSVP and spread the word
We’re building a strong security community in Buea and beyond. Whether you’re here to learn, contribute, or just stay updated this meetup is for you.
Invite a friend. Share on social media. Let’s grow together.
